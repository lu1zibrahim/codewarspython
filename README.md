I will post here my solutions and the best solutions that I find to the codewars Kata.


Hello, this is all the code as I said before, my reason to do this is to help someone that is in need.
I'm a begginer and I always try to learn from my mistakes, and here is to show that sometimes you can do the samething with a unecessary big code.
It is not the best way to do. But if it works I'm happy. After I finish my Kata, I look into the solutions and try to learn from others.
This way I can train my code doing the Kata, and after that I'll improve seeing other solutions.
For whoever is reading this. We can do it, let's learn how to code.
